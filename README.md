# hello-world
I'm creating this repository to help me learn more about GitHub.

My name is Matt, I'm a former self-employed small business ownder trying to learn all about the world of programming.
I'm hoping to make a career change to become a web developer. I'm also hoping to bring to life a couple of website ideas I've been bouncing around in my head.
I also have a passion for the great outdoors. I love camping and hiking, but I'm happiest when I'm in my kayak.
